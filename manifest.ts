/**
 * What this app says about itself when a host asks.
 *
 * ## What it is
 *
 * A terminal with one program in it: the Mistral Vibe CLI session that belongs to the place the
 * person is looking at. The sibling of the Claude and Codex modules, with the same promises: a
 * session belongs to the epic, the parts picked out of it and the kehikko, and moves when any of
 * them does.
 *
 * ## What is declared
 *
 * - **`reacts: ['parts']`**, **`scope: 'kehikko'`** (2.29.0): a session is kept for a place — this
 *   kehikko, the open epic and its picked parts.
 * - **`uses: ['activity:report']`** (1.5.0): the whole list of its sessions' states, for the Inbox;
 *   **`uses: ['events:emit']`, `emits: [NOTICES]`** for a host that does not answer the list.
 * - **`uses: ['view:expand']`** (protocol 2.58.0): in a container too small for a terminal the page
 *   is a tile, and pressing it asks the host to show the container large over the canvas. A host
 *   that does not answer the method is not asked: the tile shows the conversation in place.
 * - **`uses: ['agents:message']`** (protocol 2.41.0): `send_message` and `read_messages` on its door, a thin
 *   adapter over the host's messages between agent sessions, and a session's unread ones in its notes.
 *   A host before 2.41.0 keeps none: the door lists neither tool and the notes say nothing.
 * - **`agentSessions: { loadsSkills: true, installsSkills: true }`** (2.21.0, 2.23.0): it runs
 *   agent sessions and gives each the skills of the modules on its kehikko, and it gives skills
 *   itself — in each session's own folder (`--add-dir`, skills.ts), never anywhere a person's own
 *   Vibe reads. A host routes the kehikko-bound skills here, tells it which skills it keeps for every
 *   conversation (`everywhere`), and installs none of this module's own skills for Claude Code.
 * - **`skills`**: its own `/kehikot-here`, written for Vibe (doors.ts adds the list, whose versions
 *   follow the origin it serves on).
 * - **`mcp.as: 'kehikko-vibe'`**: the id would derive `vibe`, the name of the program an agent is
 *   likely to be, and a door called that reads as the agent's own.
 * - **`prompt: false`**: nothing here sends a prompt to anything. The person types.
 * - **`storage: true`**: the page opens a WebSocket to its own origin.
 * - **An MCP door with one tool that reads**: which sessions belong to which place.
 * - **`settings`** (2.15.0): resuming conversations a restart cut off, the model and when Vibe
 *   asks before acting — each a person's (settings.ts).
