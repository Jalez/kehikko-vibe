/**
 * What a session this module started is told of where it is, without anybody typing anything:
 * its place, and the modules on its kehikko. And the session filed under that place, as
 * `/kehikot-here` would file it.
 *
 * ## How it is told
 *
 *  - **At its start** — a new conversation, or one `/clear` makes in the same process — the whole
 *    of it: the place, one line per module on the kehikko, with its MCP server's name in this
 *    session and its skills, and the skills given to it, as `/name` entries (`skillsText`). This
 *    module writes it into the `AGENTS.md` of the session's own folder before the session starts
 *    (`startText`, called by live.ts), and Vibe puts an added directory's `AGENTS.md` into the
 *    session's instructions (its harness's `load_project_docs` over `--add-dir` roots). A resumed
 *    conversation keeps the instructions it was made with (Vibe stores them with it), so it hears
 *    of a change only as below.
 *  - **After a tool call**, only what changed since the session was last told: modules put on the
 *    kehikko or taken off it, or the conversation moved to another place by the person. Vibe has
 *    no hook at a prompt; its `post_tool` hook runs `context.sh` from the session's folder, which
 *    posts the session's id and its place token to `POST /api/context` and prints what comes
 *    back, and Vibe appends that (`hook_specific_output.additional_context`) to the tool's result.
 *    Nothing when nothing changed. A conversation never told anything (resumed from before Kehikot)
 *    is told the whole of it the first time. What it was told is kept beside its doors
 *    (`toldFile`), so a restart of this module does not tell it twice; and the folder's
 *    `AGENTS.md` is written again, so a `/clear` starts from what is true now.
 *
 * The modules are the host's to say (`modules` in its answer to `POST /host/place`, asked again
 * with the session's own token each time). A host too old to list them, or one that does not
 * answer, gets the place said and the modules left to `read_canvas`. What a module calls itself
 * and its one line are its own words: quoted, one line each, and said to be text.
 *
 * ## The filing
 *
 * A conversation this module started is filed under the place it was started at as soon as it is
 * a conversation — Vibe holds a record of it — exactly as `/kehikot-here` files one: it
 * belongs there, and is that kehikko's own when the kehikko had none (`born`). `settle` in
 * live.ts does this while this process holds the run; the hook does it whatever happened to the
 * run in between (this module restarted, the view closed, the conversation cleared into a new
 * one). Never for a conversation the record already files somewhere — it stays where the person
 * put it — nor one a person took off its place (`detached`) or said is not a Kehikot one
 * (`ignored`).
